1. Design a D-latch circuit using NAND gates or any other suitable logic gates and write a SPICE Code
2. Design a shift register using D-Latches and then write a SPICE Code for it.
3. Use D-latches in combination with logic gates to design binary counters, which can count in binary sequences and write a SPICE Code
